We use the regression analysis with mortality data to make an example of how to do some linear regression analysis in R. In the example, we use different packages such as **MASS**, **leaflet**, **ggmap**, **heatmap**, **corrplot** and so on. In the end, we show some method to do the best model selection in R based on the Mortality data.
